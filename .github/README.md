Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for British Parliamentary and a variety of two-team formats. It was used at Australs 2010 and 2012‚Äì2019, EUDC 2018, WUDC 2019‚Äì2020 and many other tournaments of all sizes and formats. To see an example of a post-tournament website, have a look at the [WUDC 2020 tab website](https://wudc2020.herokuapp.com).

**Want to try it out?** The best way to trial Tabbycat is just to launch a new site, as described [in our user guide](https://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/heroku.html) (or [below](#installation-and-user-guide)). It takes just a few clicks, costs nothing, requires no technical background, and you can always deploy a fresh copy when you're ready to run your tournament.

## üîç Features

- Deployable to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for an easy, fast, and free setup
- Enter data from multiple computers simultaneously and (optionally) display results, draws, and other information online
- Collect ballots and feedback online, or from printed forms customised for each round ( adjudicator feedback questions and rankings [are configurable](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/adjudicator-feedback.html))
- Automated adjudicator allocations based on adjudicator ranking, debate priority, and conflicts/clashes
- A drag and drop interface for adjudicator allocation that displays conflicts alongside break liveness and gender/regional/language balance considerations
- A responsive interface that adapts to suit large screens, laptops, tablets, and phones
- Support for British Parliamentary (EUDC/WUDC), Australs, NZ Easters, Australian Easters, Joynt Scroll, UADC, and WSDC rule sets as well as configurable [draw generation rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/draw-generation.html) and [team standings rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/standings-rules.html)

## üìñ Documentation

Our user guide is at [tabbycat.readthedocs.io](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/).

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Installation

Tabbycat can be deployed in a number of ways. While you can set it up to [run on your own computer](https://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/local.html) most users will want to run it as a website.

Tabbycat is configured for a '1 click' install to the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) web platform. Click this button to begin:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat/tree/master)

While the baseline Heroku hosting is free, some features require additional setup and larger tournaments will likely need to pay for greater hosting capacities. As an alternative, the [Calico](https://calicotab.com/) service will host Tabbycat sites for a flat fee while also managing all scaling/configuration concerns and providing ongoing access to the released tab.

## üí™ Support and Contributing

## ¬©Ô∏è Licence

We haven't released Tabbycat under an open-source licence, so there is no formal and general right to use this software. Nonetheless, you're welcome to freely use Tabbycat to help run a debating tournament. However, if your tournament is run as a for-profit or for-fundraising activity a donation to Tabbycat's maintainers is required. More details [are available in our licence information](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/licence.html).
